* What did you learn from implementing a multi-agent workflow?
While implementing this multi-agent travel planning system, it taught me the importance of role specialization such as a planner or reviewer in agent workflows. I think that clear task boundaries also will make each agent more effective. For example, the Planner would focus on structured itinerary creation and Reviewer would validate the feasibility using internet_search. Moreover, separating planning and validation will reduce bias and improved accuracy through iterative refinement. The Reviewer's delta list also creates specific and actionable feedback loop. Lastly, I learned that precise prompts and constraints will define agent success. For example, giving Planner clear structure guides and strict fact-checking guidelines in Reviewer to minimize hallucinations and ensure realistic and trustworthy travel plan.

* Challenges faced and how you addressed them.
One of the challenges I faced is how to best balance specificity, meaning that to what extent should I provide detailed structure for the Planner to ensure high quality without making outputs rigid. Therefore, I combined required formats with some flexible best practices to maintain creativity and consistency. Another challenge I faced is how to streamline the handoff between Planner and Reviewer. At the end, I optimized the Planner's output with clear formatting, and cost details to enable Reviewer to more efficiently verify information.

* Any creative ideas, variations, or design choices (e.g., persona roles, prompt design).
For persona driven prompts, each agent has a distinctive persona. For example, Planner is expert in travel planning, and meticulous reviewer. This roleplay would guide the model behavior which Planner would be more creative and comprehensive, and Reviewer becomes thorough during validation. The Streamlit UI shows the validated result prominently, but also keep the raw Planner output in an expander at the end of the response. With this approach, it’s clear to the user the whole process and to understand both the original and revised itinerary. I also added in some considerations such as hours of operation as sometimes travel planning might fail on suggesting the right activities due to factor such as seasonality. This also made the Reviewer fact-checking more meaningful.

* Note any external tools or GenAI assistance used and why.
I have used Claude to brainstorm the prompt design and flow. For example, for understanding how to make the instructions as "show, don't tell" by providing specific examples of format requirement.
