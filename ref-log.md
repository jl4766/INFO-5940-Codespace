## Documentation:
1. added langchain-chroma to requirements.txt
2. Used langgraph_chroma_retreiver.ipynb for coding reference

## External Tools Used:
1. Langchain: https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/install
2. Streamlit: https://docs.streamlit.io/

## AI usage:
I used Claude as a learning and debugging assistant, mostly for load_document and process_documents functions and errors.
Claude was helpful in providing problem solving options, but sometimes it oversight some of the minor codings inconsistencies.
